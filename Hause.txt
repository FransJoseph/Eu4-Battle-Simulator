https://anbennar.fandom.com/wiki/Hold_of_Gor_B%C3%BBrad
Legend says that the foundations of the hold was built on the corpse of a Fire Giant.
That was the explanation for other dwarfs for their short-temperament, suspiciousness of outsiders and quickness to fight. (I will fix it i promise)
Basalt Dwarves themselves taught that they were once refused aid by the other dwarves during a terrible famine,
and that this is what started their anger and isolationism.

The Basalt Dwarves had an exception as they traded with Gor Dûrgheled, supplying them with raw obsidian which enhanced their rune magic,
allowing for friendly relations to form between both holds.

A renowned legend describes the longest Borbordûz - Gor Bûrad tradition ever: three nobles fought for a week straight to decide who would rule the hold.
The fighters were called Storum the Stern, Adar Moonreacher and Magni the Vindictive. In the end, Magni was the only survivor and took his place as ruler of Gor Bûrad.
Contemporaries attributed this to his fine equipment, which had been forged by the famous blacksmith Calin-Thror Flameforge.

Creation of Serpent's Vale irrigation system
https://anbennar.fandom.com/wiki/Serpent%27s_Vale
The ancient dwarves used the Serpent's Vale for agriculture. With terrace farming and irrigation from the mountain rivers,
they made the region very productive despite its soil not being particularly rich. It was wise for the High King to make his home later here,
for much of the underground population was dependent on grain and vegetables from the Serpent's Vale.

??? - Before Aegis was added to Dwarovkron
It was said that Morzad Ringbeard from Verkal Kozenad, an aspiring thief planned a heist to rob the Aegis of Arg-Ôrdstun before it was added to the Dwarovkron.
Morzad had found a way in using a tunnel that had not been collapsed after the building of the vault. Surprised,
he and his men entered the tunnel to find a way into the vault when he noticed that many supports had been removed from the tunnel.
Fear overcame him and as he shuffled around, he kicked some dust in the air and let out a sneeze,
which echoed out in the tunnel which triggered the last support to collapse, burying the thieves under the vault which in reality was just a decoy.

The Goblinslayer academy is founded by the famous retired Mithradhûm general Thorin Goblinslayer, which he used to teach the soldiers of the hold his mastery
of tactics and warfare. After his passing, the academy was still used and state-sponsored,
which further instilled a military culture to the soldiers of the hold, making them perfect candidates for the Amldavhad Guard as well as mercenaries.

Ducaniel was faced with a large dwarven army set to reconquer Hul-Jorkad.
Without access to elven reinforcements, Ducaniel's forces quickly lost what ground they had managed to take,
and were pushed back to the lower levels of the hold. When reaching the fourth and final level (the last one - holds article confirms), Ducaniel starts his experiments.

After almost 100 years of experiments, by combining the genetic material of goblins, elves, and even some ogres, Ducaniel created the orcs.
Horde after horde of newly created Orcs started attacking the hold from within, wiping out dwarven garrison in hold.
It is believed that no dwarves from the hold made it out alive after the initial assault.
This outbreak mark the beginning of the next age, the Orcish Warpath.

Eastern regions of Aul-Dwarov were cut off from Amldihr by the orcs.
Hold of Grônstunad becomes the nominal capital of Eastern Aul-Dwarov.
Meanwhile placed Gor Vazumbrog place itself under martial law in order to facilitate attempts to break through to Hul-Jorkad.
As the war wage in the West Dwarovar, Grônstunad slowly starts to centralize power in the Tree of Stone and Middle Dwarovar,
sending Jade Dwarf Overseers to positions of power within the holds.

Ducaniel's Campaign

5998 BA
https://anbennar.fandom.com/wiki/Hold_of_Verkal_Kozenad
First orcs were spoted outside of Verkal Kozenad, catching their King Mufnir VII off guard
and he surrenders his hold to Ducaniel and promises to support him with supplies, facing hold destruction by the orcs.
Knowing Verkal Kozenad was the first in the way to the crucial rail hub of the Dwarovar - Er-Natvir,
Mufnir hoped to fake his assistance to Ducaniel to betray him with a surprise attack once he had the chance.


5990 BA
Moving to Er-Natvir, Ducaniel marched on it from both the western and southern entrances
In response to this threat, Ânumdihr (Marhold) collapsed the Escanni-Dwarovar tunnel, cutting themselves off from the Serpentspine for thousands of years.
https://anbennar.fandom.com/wiki/Kingdom_of_Marrhold
Some sources state that much of the hold was also collapsed.

Meanwhile, an orcish party had headed through the eastern tunnels and blocked Er-Natvir's northern gate, completely isolating it from support by the other holds.
https://anbennar.fandom.com/wiki/Hold_of_Verkal_Kozenad
When orcs worked to set up an encampment by the southern gate, Mufnir found the chance to cross Ducaniel
and launched a surprise attack on the orcs to relieve the siege. Initially winning, but eventually overwhelmed, being vastly outnumbered, leaving Er-Natvir alone once more.
Ducaniel was furious at Mufnir’s betrayal, but was preoccupied with the siege of Er-Natvir. With that, 20 years of stagnation begins.

5970 BA
With the rest of the campaign planned, Ducaniel manage to send a large host of orcs that wipes out every single Opal Dwarf remaining in Verkal Kozenad hold.
This made it the first to be attacked by the orcs, first to attempt peace, and first to betray it right after. 20 years of stagnation also ends with this.

5934 BA - The Fall of Er-Natvir
Supplies from the various trains stranded within Er-Natvir were distributed to residents in an attempt to wait out the siege,
but in the end these dwindled and the hold was left starving and ill-prepared by the time it fell to the orcs.
Wiht that success, Ducaniel splits his forces between the Dwarovrod and Daginrod - Ducaniel began to better understand the time it would take to siege the various holds.

5925 BA
Ducaniel lefts a moderate force of orcs to siege Mithradhûm, but not enough to seize it, just to prevent them from interfering with his imminent attack on Amldihr

5920 BA - War for the King's Rock
Orcs march through the Amloz tunnel to besiege the Hall of the Ancestors, as the Dwarovrod forces marched through the Amlvaz tunnel to besiege Verkal Vazkron.

5918 BA
Ducaniel finished plan after 2 years. A large host of orcs was sent along the Dwarovrod and its eastern caves to find a natural exit. Failing to do so, orcs digs breach from caves.
Another host was sent to block the roads to the west to prevent the remaining holds from interfering.

5915 BA
With the tunnel nearing completion, Ducaniel sent a party of orcs further up the Dagrinrod to distract Orlazam-az-dihr, harassing the hold and skirmishing with their rangers.

5914 BA
Orcs breaks through into Vale at what is now known as "Orcsbreach". This was spotted nigh instantly by from various watchtowers.
As the orcs moved south to pillage and burn the crops, the dwarven armies assembled to meet them, thus starting the Battles of the Serpent's Vale.
Dwurim IX, the High King, sent his forces of mostly infantry and cannons, along with the Amldavhad itself, through the Southern Entrance to meet the orcs head on.
Meanwhile, Hurnik XIV, King of Orlazam-az-dihr, sent his fabled Ram Riders led by renowned general Wolin Greybuckle west to attack the orcs from the north.
The three armies clashed and the orcs were decimated in combat, pushed back to the caves and stragglers killed.
Dwarves attempted to barricade the breach but were forced to abandon it after a larger host of orcs attacked from the breach.
Exhausted, the dwarves were unable to resist and retreat with considerable losses.
The Amldavhad held the line, allowing Amldihr forces to retreat to their hold while the Ram Riders, demoralized by the death of Wolin Greybuckle, flee back to Orlazam-Az-Dihr.

??? - No clue at what moment during the siege
https://anbennar.fandom.com/wiki/Serpent%27s_Vale
In desperation, the High King diverted the Vale's irrigation canals to flood the Vale. This significantly damaged the orcish army,
but did not prevent the eventual fall of Amldhir. The valley is to this day still flooded in many areas, and farming is now nearly impossible.

5910 BA
https://anbennar.fandom.com/wiki/Hold_of_Amldihr
After a series of skirmishes and battles spanning 4 years, with the retreat of the dwarven forces, the Orcs had completely secured the Vale are able to besiege
Verkal Vazkron from the Southern Entrance without resistance.

It is noted that this moment represents a tipping point, where the ever-increasing numbers of the orcs led to Ducaniel slowly losing control.

5895 BA - Battle of Amldihr

It would take 15 years for the dwarven defenders to finally break, as supplies, manpower, and morale slowly ran out.
Verkal Vazkron fell to the Orcs, spurring a final attempt from the dwarven holds to retake the fortress.

The final battle for Amldihr would begin.
While the orcs broke through the gates of Verkal Vazkron, the western holds of Khugdihr, Ovdal Asra, and Haraz Orldhûm joined forces, putting aside past grievances,
to mount a saving of Amldihr. As the western forces overcame the barricades and garrisons that Ducaniel placed to keep the flank secure,
High King Dwurim IX and King Hurmik XIV prepared their own armies from within Amldihr.

King Hurnik sent his fastest ram rider north to Krakdhûmvror to request aid,
though their Clan Council, led by Thorar Trollslayer, was hesitant to send out its forces. They believed that even if the entire Dwarovar fell, they would stand.
In the end, worried that history would remember them as betrayers or cowards, the Grim Legion of Krakdhûmvror clad in Ice-Steel would not march north to fight the old giants of yore,
but south, to save an empire that had shunned them. With the Grim Legion on the way, the Battle for Amldihr truly began.

Remnants of Kronium and Ramsteel armies sally out of Amldihr and meet the orcs head on in Verkal Vazkron, trapping the orc armies. In major part due to the Grim Legion,
by the day's end every orc that had stepped foot in Verkal Vazkron lay dead. To the dismay of the dwarves, an even larger orcish horde quickly approached,
retaking the Amlvaz tunnel and trapping the western armies in Verkal Vazkron.

https://anbennar.fandom.com/wiki/Hold_of_Amldihr
Whilst the armies engaged, the orcs in the east had managed to finally overcome the Hall of the Ancestors and barely six months later in that same year
after the fall of Verkal Vazkron, and the death of the Grim legion, the orcs were directly assaulting Amldihr proper.

5888 BA - The fall of Amldihr and Aul-Dwarov
Orcs broke into Amldihr through Verkal Vazkron and the Hall of the Ancestors with ease, with little to no defenders left to hold them back on any dwarven flank.
Overtaking the Amlharaz from within Amldihr itself, the orcs had achieved full control over the King's Rock and the crushing defeat of Aul-Dwarov.

Ducaniel, having lost control over a majority of the orcs due to their innumerable quantity,
attempted to keep the loyalty of what orcs did still follow him by shattering the Dwarovkron and gifting it to them. The battle of Amldihr formally ends with that event.
Ultimately, this would backfire as the orcs now saw themselves as conquerors.

https://anbennar.fandom.com/wiki/Hold_of_Mithradh%C3%BBm
With Ducaniel leaving the Dwarovar after Amldihr fell, the Orcs that were left believed they were the conquerors and many left Amldihr to destroy more of the Dwarven holds.

Reestablishment of Segbandal and fall of the western holds ========================================================================================================================
https://anbennar.fandom.com/wiki/Segbandal

???
Hold Gor Ozumbrog was completed. Her Topaz dwarves develop martial society due to dire circumstances.

5895 BA - Segbandal rebellion
With the fall of Amldihr, Grônstunad declared itself as the overlord of Aul-Dwarov and established the Jade Empire.
However, with Gor Vazumbrog loyal to Amldihr due to its ancestral charge immediately severed ties with Grônstunad.
Both the holds of Seghdihr and Hehodovar were also eager to dispose of the Jade Overseers in their land and joined the rebellion against the Jade Dwarves.
Shortly after, the eastern holds of Verkal Gulan and Gor Ozumbrog joined which secured the Middle Dwarovar.

5880 BA
Having completed his objective, Ducaniel departed back for Aelantir with what treasures and knowledge he had gained, leaving the orcs to their own devices.

https://anbennar.fandom.com/wiki/Hold_of_Khugdihr
https://anbennar.fandom.com/wiki/Hold_of_Haraz_Orldh%C3%BBm
There is a major inconsistiency here with the date of fall of Ovdal Asra Hold
Ovdal Asra is identical to Khugdihr article first paragraphs
Both of them say that orcs were heading towards Khugdihr and were stopped by collapse of Ovdal Asra in 5850 BA,
despite Haraz Orldhûm being rather earlier on the way - Ovdal Asra supposed location was Asra Depths.
In contrast, Haraz Orldhûm article says that Ovdal Asra fell in 5870 BA. After that fall orcs headed to besige Haraz Orldhûm.

5876 BA
https://anbennar.fandom.com/wiki/Dwarovar_Railway
Dwarovar Railways were officially declared defunct after they quickly fell into disrepair after fall of Er-Natvir.
Their stopping cut-off many holds and supplies lines that eventually led to the fall of dwarven civilization.

When the railway was shutdown long-distance communication was no longer possible and any dwarven armies in the field, such as in the halls, tunnels and highway,
fell apart from disorganization and logistical problems, some like Harnul the Good, who was trapped in the middle of the rail system,
decided to continue on foot with his men to their original destination whilst others deserted for their homes or settled at the nearest hold.

The lack of communication led to the isolationist stance we see from dwarven holds today, without any effective way of coordination between nearby holds,
the surviving holds developed a defensive and independent attitude and often refused to make contact or even help outsiders, dwarf or otherwise.

Without food, water and goods coming in through the highway, many holds fell into chaos and starvation.

Initially, holds close to the surface fared better than their deeper counterparts, unlike deep holds which became increasingly isolationist and hostile,
the outer holds became more reliant on outside relations and trade to sustain themselves. However, their reliance on the surface eventually made them vulnerable to blockade,
especially during the time of the Phoenix Empire. Luckily most outer holds had grown self-sufficient by then but as a consequence are now more selective with who they deal with.

On the extreme side, some dwarves decided to abandon the Dwarovar completely. These early dwarves established settlement and became 
uasi-kings and nobles over the less advanced inhabitants such as humans. Later on the dwarves played a major role in uplifting human society as a whole,
as well as aiding in the creation of many rising urban centers, establishing a strong dwarven mercantile class that still dominates today.

The Sacrifice of Ovdal Asra
https://anbennar.fandom.com/wiki/Hold_of_Ovdal_Asra
https://anbennar.fandom.com/wiki/Hold_of_Khugdihr

King Murnir IX of Ovdal Asra sent his heir and as many dwarves as possible to flee the Serpentspine through nearby caves,
leaving only the most defiant dwarves along with their Golems to fight against the horde of orcs. After many heated battles,
King Murnir IX ordered a mad but self proclaimed valorous decision to collapse the surrounding caverns and Dwarovrod 3,
burying every dwarf and orc in the rubble while saving the hold of Khugdihr from the orcish tides for many years.
For this noble sacrifice, King Murnir IX was forever remembered as "The Vengeful".

Escape to Khugdihr
Many of the evacuated dwarves managed to flee into Cannor, with most making their way to Khugdihr.
The Pink Agate Dwarves of Ovdal Asra and the Moss Agate Dwarves of Khugdihr intermingled with each other when coexisting in the secure Hold
which eventually caused both cultures to meld into the modern Agate Dwarf.

https://anbennar.fandom.com/wiki/Hold_of_Haraz_Orldh%C3%BBm
Fall of Ovdal Asra made orcish horde target Haraz Orldhûm which was weak after their army was defeated in Verkal Vazkron.
All the hold had left was 1000 warriors, 100 warsuits, 2000 slaves and one weak queen.
At the beginning, the orcs tried to besiege the hold via the caverns surrounding it which proved to be a disaster.
The Turrets of Orldhûm were a death trap to the orcs with none being able to traverse the caveswithout getting bombarded from multiple directions.
Queen Tharit II “The Weak” was reigning during the time of the siege and proved to be one of the weakest rulers Haraz Orldhûm had ever seen,
as she delegated her issues in the hold to her advisors to fix and being all around incompetent.

5860 BA - The Fall of Mithradhûm
https://anbennar.fandom.com/wiki/Hold_of_Mithradh%C3%BBm

For 65 years the hold stood against the orcs. Many orcs joined the token force left by Ducaniel and defeated the starved dwarves quickly, wiping out the Mithril Dwarves.

5850 BA - The Fall of Orlazam-az-dihr
https://anbennar.fandom.com/wiki/Hold_of_Orlazam-az-dihr
The orcs had reached the outskirts of Orlazam-az-dihr. Hold had lost all of their armies at the battle of Amldihr and had only guards and reserve forces left.
Faced with a prolonged siege and the slow starvation of his hold, King Hurnik XIV ordered a last charge by all able forces.
This last charge was a devastating blow against the orc forces and incurred heavy losses, but in the end all Ramsteel forces would be killed in the charge.

5850 BA - Call for reestablishment of Segbandal
After a series of skirmishes near Gor Vazumbrog under the banner of the Jade Empire,
the Citrine Dwarves of Seghdihr called the other 4 kings of the Middle Dwarovar to formally join in restoring the ancient alliance of the Segbandal,
in order to unite against all internal and external threats.

5848 BA - Reestablishment of the Segbandal
After two years, the Segbandal was reforged as an alliance of equals, vowing to aid each other especially to the frontier holds of Gor Vazumbrog and Gor Ozumbrog
from any menace that would challenge the Segbandal.

5770 BA (or 5750 BA?) - Slaves overtake Haraz Orldhûm
After 100 years of prolonged fighting with a depleted number of dwarf defenders, Queen Tharit II of Haraz Orldhûm decided to offer the dwarf slaves freedom in exchange
for the defense of the hold which was cautioned as a bad idea by her people, but ended up happening as she saw it to be just.

The Last Blunder of Tharit II
The freeing of the slaves proved to be yet another mistake of the queen as the angry slaves quickly overpowered their former captors and hanged Tharit II,
seizing power yet being oblivious to the dire situation they found themselves in.

5762 BA - 3591 BA - Segbandalic Expeditions
They were a series of offensive expeditions to the West Dwarovar by the combined forces of the Segbandal which spanned for over two millennia.
The main goal of the expeditions were to reclaim Hul-Jorkad and beyond from orcish control and to strengthen their defenses past Gor Vazumbrog.
The expeditions succeeded in reclaiming Hul-Jorkad and the Jorkad Junction, even reaching Verkal Kozenad and reclaiming the Citrine and Jade Gems of the Dwarovkron.

5750 BA (or 5730 BA?) - The Fall of Haraz Orldhûm
The former slaves managed maintain a defense of the hold for 20 more years until the goblin slaves of the hold revolted and opened the gates for the orcs.
With the Platinum Dwarves wiped out, the goblins traded one master for another, leaving the orcs to rule over the ruined hold.

5738 BA - The Frozen War
By this time, West Dwarovar was entirely crushed by the orcs. Craving a challenge, the orcs headed north towards the Giant's Anvil
which was detached from the rest of the Serpentspine Mountains, however, the Quartz Dwarves stood ever defiant.
They had abandoned their outposts in the Northern Pass and retreated to the entrance of the Giant's Anvil
which was guarded by Kar Durghoir, the Citadel of Dark Ice, where the Quartz Dwarves had an overwhelming advantage.

Their use of Ice-Smithing coupled with decades of warfare meant that the Quartz Dwarves were far more experienced than any other hold in the Western Dwarovar.
All this, however, did not stop the orcs from throwing themselves at the citadel, which caused a war dragging on for years in which the orcs started losing interest in,
with many stopping their attempts of sieging the citadel and leaving to other parts of the Dwarovar, but some stayed and maintained their siege.

Siege of the Serpentreach ======================================================================================================================================
https://anbennar.fandom.com/wiki/Siege_of_the_Serpentreach

5488 BA
Roaming orc hordes that had destroyed the West Dwarovar march south to Hul-Jorkad and meet up with the orc forces who had been ordered to
blockade the Arg Tunad to the Serpentreach and the Vazok Tunad to the Segbandal of the Middle Dwarovar.

This period would see the various sieges of the Serpentreach and the fall of its holds, though no progress would be made against the Segbandal for the over 5000 year period.

5400 BA - The Breach
After 88 years of brutal warfare attempting to break into the Serpentreach, the orcs managed to breach the mountains and seize control over the Argrod Junction.
Even with the Junction taken, the orcs then found themselves facing the might of the tenuous alliance of the Serpentreach holds
led by Arg-Ôrdstun with the exception of Gor Bûrad and as such made little progress for numerous years.

Branching off the Argrod Junction, the orcs would suffer minor setbacks as they headed southeast towards and by the Basalt Dwarves,
but ultimately forced the dwarves to retreat back into their hold.
The Basalt dwarves, defiant of Diamond rule, were alone and believed that they would do best that way. They retreated to their hold, anticipating an eventual siege.
With the upper Argrod line undefended, the orcs began to sweep through the southeastern rails up to the very gates of Gor Bûrad.

5284 BA - siege of Gor Bûrad (inconsistency what siege in Serpentreach was first)
It would result in countless skirmishes between the orcs and the dwarves who wielded far superior knowledge of their own volcano.

4839 BA
Over a hundred years since breaching the Serpentreach, little progress had been made by the orcs in terms of western progress.
This roaming horde, no longer directed by Ducaniel, proved to be less effective than prior against the well trained and disciplined dwarven armies.
Still, with their superior numbers progress was still made.

Mercy of Lodhum
Ovdal Lodhum, being closest to the Argrod Junction, was naturally the first to be reached by the orcs (inconsistency).
Ruled by King Lorim the Warmheart, known for his immense love for his people and benevolent rule, despite his hold subservience to Arg-Ôrdstun,
made the choice to pull the Garnet Dwarves from the front lines into the hold, sealing the gates.

4624 BA - Siege of Ovdal Lodhum
Unlike the other holds that found themselves starving and cut off from the world, Lodhum would find themselves relatively unbothered.
Said to be "bound by love" more than heritage, there are no records of attempted harm between dwarf, that each dwarf shared food equally,
and that some would even sacrifice their own shares for those in need.
It is commonly agreed that this is what allowed the Garnet Dwarves to survive where other holds had failed.

https://anbennar.fandom.com/wiki/Hold_of_Ovdal_Lodhum
With the orcs not having much time to attempt to siege the hold, as they were actively fighting the other dwarves of the Serpentreach.
their futile attempts failed  and they , on their futile attempts on Lodhum's gates.
The orcs then chose to pursue the holds in the west, slowing advancing onto Verkal Skomdihr.

The Labyrinth
After bypassing Ovdal Lodhum, the orcish horde found their way to the Hold of Verkal Skomdihr, yet were unable to actually reach the hold.
Standing between them and the hold was Kekig's Labyrinth. Multitudes of orcs went into the labyrinth but no orc was able to breach past it, leaving Verkal Skomdihr safe.

4611 BA
Flint Dwarves retreated back into the hold regardless and locked the gates as the orcs continued towards Arg-Ôrdstun.

The Diamond Queen
Without Ovdal Lodhum and Verkal Skomdihr, the alliance led by Arg-Ôrdstun found themselves at roughly half their original strength.
The remaining holds of Arg-Ôrdstun, Orlghelovar, and Shazstundihr were forced to levy their populations for the war in turn, where even the nobles were forced to participate.

It would be in a defense of the Diamond Quarry, where many of Arg-Ôrdstun's fabled gems were mined, that King Borri Stormheart of Arg-Ôrdstun would fall and throw the Diamond Dwarves into a panic.
Sigrid, his daughter, took upon the crown and immediately began implementing battle strategies rather than frontal assaults.
Using the various twists and turns of the mines along with its sharp corners and narrow passageways to limit the orcish numbers,
The Diamond Quarry, Greater Mines, and Lesser Mines became akin to a hunting grounds for the dwarves.

The shafts, trenches, winches, platforms, and all manners of transportation and geography allowed the Diamond dwarves to both effectively kill off groups of orcs
and disappear as quickly as they appeared. When the disorganized orcs would chase the dwarves down a shaft they would only be met with traps and their own deaths.
Lacking any form of advanced logistics that they had prior, they continue to pour into the mines without the knowledge of the previous incursions.

Eventually, the drastically slowed orcs with their dwindled numbers and morale shattered gave up on entering Arg-Ôrdstun through the caves and instead
returned to the Argrod line to continue their advance.

4538 BA
Queen Sigrid Stormheart, remembered as the Diamond Queen, issued a final decree to never leave the hold and to outlast the orcs.

4408 BA - establishment of Logrod-Tûngr (Segbandal article)
The first stones of "River Harbour" were laid outside of Seghdihr, on the banks of the Suran, formalizing a thousand years of occasional meetings
and tent-camp exchanges where the dwarves of Seghdihr come to meet with inquisitive Genies and their servants, trading foodstuffs, wood, and other rare materials
such as ivory that cannot be found in the Serpentspine. In exchange for these goods is the bounty of the Serpentspine consisting of dwarven crafts and artworks,
as well as various creatures and products made from them.

Furthermore, the establishment of Logrod-Tûngr eased communications sent to the remaining holds of the Serpentreach,
departing via boat from the river harbour down the Suran, before disembarking further down the river and traversing the rest of the journey on foot.

Fall of the Rails

3800 BA
1688 years after the orcs first breached the Serpentreach, the dwarf holds of Shazstundihr and Orlghelovar decided to return to their holds and shut their gates,
much like the other holds of the region. Being surface holds they were able to scavenge, farm, and trade on the surface even with their entrances to the Serpentspine cut off,
The rails of the Serpentreach then came fully under the control of the orcish hordes.

3641 BA - the fall of Gor Bûrad
The siege which had begun 1643 years earlier finally reached its conclusion when the the volcano Ghelebûr Krakdhûm erupted
and allowed lava to creep into the upper levels of Gor Bûrad. With the heat softening the great gate, the orcs finally managed to break it down.
The Basalt Dwarves perished as a result but they are often remembered among dwarves as those that stood longer than all the other northern dwarves combined.

3640 BA - Growing Attrition - Krakdhûmvror
https://anbennar.fandom.com/wiki/Hold_of_Krakdh%C3%BBmvror
Many of the orcs that had left for the Dwarovar had returned north, seeking to get past Kar Durghoir but to no avail.
However, the Quartz Dwarves started to run out of supplies which would originally be obtained from the rest of the Dwarovar,
and with their outposts in the Northern Pass abandoned, they also lacked the means to hunt for food.
What food they had was what little their small scouting parties had managed to bring back and the ramshackle fungal farms they had set up in the the caves,
nevertheless, the Quartz Dwarves still managed to hold off the orcs for many more years.

https://anbennar.fandom.com/wiki/Hold_of_Krakdh%C3%BBmvror
One one fateful day, the Ice-Smiths were preparing to drop an enormous block of ice on the besieging orcs, but with a single catapult shot, everything changed.
Whether by luck or great skill, the shot hit the platform on which the Ice-Smiths were preparing,
and the sudden destruction misfired the spell and caused the ice to drop onto the gates of Kar Durghoir.
This greatly weakened the gate and the orcs wasted no time in exploiting this, the citadel held against the orcs for 3157 years but with the gates destroyed,
the orcs poured into the Giant's Anvil with the Quartz Dwarves still refusing to give an inch of the caves.

2535 BA - Siege of Krakdhûmvror
The orcs had finally managed to reach the hold of Krakdhûmvror, yet unlike Kar Durghoir, the hold was nigh impregnable.
The resources of the Dead End Caves were still plentiful and above all else, completely safe. The lack of food however was beginning to become problematic for the Quartz Dwarves.
At first the orcs attempted to siege the hold like the ones before it but then realized it was a foolish mistake, the gates were forged from Ice-Steel.
Any damage to the gate was almost instantly repaired by the flowing steel. The orcs sieged the hold for 80 years, trying anything they could to breach the gate,
at one point, an orc named Aakax Rockskull even attempted to lick the gates, thinking he could lick the ice off of it.
Only a few orcish tribes stayed in the Giant’s Anvil, with the rest leaving to find other challenges.

From Khugdihr artile: TBD
https://anbennar.fandom.com/wiki/Hold_of_Khugdihr

Castanorian records state that the first major dwarven migration to the fledgling human empire was from the exiled dwarves of Khugdihr, ones aged more than a century who had kept their old faith in the Dwarven Pantheon when the rulers of Khugdihr had banned the practice. The dwarves ended up settling and working in the land of Cannor and with the arrival of the legendary Balgar the Builder, built most of Castonath and later, his many other wonders.

Maintaining the inventories of adventurers, soldiers, and builders was a large task for the Empire of Aul-Dwarov, as the need for precise numbers was paramount for success. The Agate Dwarves took pride in their role as the main bookkeepers and organisers of the Dwarovar, assuring equipment contracts were always complete, supplies always ended up in the right hands, and the contents of each adventuring backpack were verified. Many dwarves of other holds would see this as unnecessary, rather relying on their own records, but the Agate Dwarves knew that overconfidence was a slow and insidious killer.

Khugdihr had fallen many times to enemy forces: whether it be in civil war; to Nimrith the Red; or to the Orcs. The position of Khugdihr made it face the threats of the ever growing hostile surface with Giants and many other creatures seeking to destroy the hold. However, as many times as the hold has fallen, it has stubbornly risen back up, stronger than before against the countless threats on both sides of the gates.

A New Age
Abandonment of the Dwarven Pantheon
In 1326 BA, isolated from the rest of the Dwarovar, the Agate Dwarves found it increasingly difficult to worship gods that did not help them in their time of need. Many of the dwarves abandoned the Dwarven Pantheon with a few clans converting over to Ancestor Worship the following years as well. All except for the Oathstone Clan who remained firm in their beliefs.

Exile of the Oathstones
The Agate Dwarves had enough of the Oathstones and their refusal to abandon the Pantheon, with the young King Storum Carûm in particular, being very irritated that dwarves more stubborn than himself existed. He confronted the Oathstone patriarch for one final attempt to convert the stubborn dwarves, yet Patriarch Karrom Oathstone only replied with “In the darkest of moments, the gods’ light shines the brightest”.

Thus in 643 BA, a decree was made, outlining that any dwarf aged more than a century that worshipped the old Pantheon had to leave the hold and worship their faith on the surface.

Balgar’s Exile
When the Oathstone Decree was made, Balgar was a mere 58 years old. He was exempt from it for now, but he had no intentions of abandoning his faith. He would slowly incorporate the Pantheon into his works, notably creating works involving Anvelind Hearthmaiden and Margurz the Brewmaster. At first the dwarves dismissed this to be a young dwarf’s foolishness, but once Balgar reached the age of 63, his not so subtle creations got problematic. Great monuments to the Pantheon were made that outshone most of the hold’s creations leading him to soon be exiled to the surface in 638 BA despite not reaching his century day.

Despite his exile, Balgar would always be remembered for his mastery of stone. Eventually becoming a worshipped ancestor in the hold that exiled him, and two years later in 636 BA, Balgar would meet Castan the Progenitor and enter into his service.

Cooperation with Castanor
The Treaty of Castan Dwarf-Friend
Under the reign of Castan Dwarf-Friend, the alliance of Castanor, Khugdihr, Ovdal Tûngr, Shazstundihr, and Rubyhold attempted the resettlement of the long abandoned hold of Ânumdihr in 549 BA, with the new inhabitants being mainly Stone Dwarves and numerous other dwarves seeking a new life.

The Giant War
One year after the Giants War began, the hold of Khugdihr joined forces with Castanor in 406 BA to drive back the giants in the north. They launched a surprise attack out of their northern caves, allowing them to deal devastating damage to the giants before they are forced to retreat back to the hold. After that initial assault, the Agate Dwarves would resort to guerrilla tactics for the duration of the war.

A hero had however emerged in 397 BA, a dwarf named Murri joined an expedition into the lands of the giants several years after the start of the war. When his expedition was defeated, however, Murri was one of very few survivors. Rather than going home and accepting defeat, Murri led this small band on an extended guerrilla campaign in the Northern Pass, becoming feared among the armies of the giants. As one of his ambushes failed, he alone held a mountain pass against the giants to allow his companions to escape, and tell the tales of his deeds back in Khugdihr. Many years later, his corpse was found, surrounded by the remains of a dozen giants which earned him the title “Giantbreaker”.

Lacking the resources and manpower to look for resources in the already exhausted Dead End Caverns, the Quartz Dwarves abandoned the caves,
redirecting their resources to providing food for its declining population. It is during these trying times that the five great clans of Krakdhûmvror become entrenched.
Clan Iceheart oversaw military leadership and command. Clan Trollslayer managed recruitment and training. Clan Earthstriker took over what mines remained.
Clan Shalebeard managed the population and census. While Clan Frozenforge attempted to find the best for the people.

The Dragonwake

Humans move to Marrhold
https://anbennar.fandom.com/wiki/Kingdom_of_Marrhold

Nimrith the Red’s Attack
Cannor was rocked by chaos like never before, with the Dragonwake causing dragons taking flight and destroying much in their path. Unfortunately for the Dwarovar, it was no different. In the section of the Dwarovrod once collapsed by King Murnir the Vengeful, something had awoken in 470. This was the great dragon Nimrith the Red, who burst forth from the rubble beneath, forming a great hole rent from the earth, and opening the path to Khugdihr once more to the greater Dwarovar.

The gates leading to the Dwarovrod had long since been left to fall into a state of disrepair, not that they would have stood anyways against the full might of the enraged dragon. Barely was there time to ring the alarm before the gate’s garrison was consumed in dragon flame and devoured in turn.

Many were caught in Nimrith’s flames but due to Nimrith's rage, his path was rather straightforward- the gate leading to the surface, and Castanor. Those who did not flee from the dragon’s path were food for the dragon. Nimrith would then burn his way through the hold, taking flight from Khugdihr to terrorise the rest of Cannor. After his departure, a number of refugees would flee the devastated hold, as the pathway to the Dwarovar now lay open. Those few who remained behind attempted to repair the hold to the best of their ability.

Arrival of the Darkscales
One by one, the remaining dwarves of Khugdihr would claim to see dragons in the dark. Bipedal and small, their forms stalked the scorched halls that had been abandoned and partially melted by dragon flame. The remaining Agate Dwarves, unbeknownst to them, had encountered kobolds, drawn to the site where Nimrith had awakened, and ready to prepare the hold for his perceived return. The kobolds themselves had emerged from the tunnel in which Nimrith had awakened. It is at this point, through the broken gate to the Dwarovar that a small horde of kobolds emerged. This is what finally drove out the last of the stubborn dwarven holdouts from Khugdihr in 476, with even those insane few who tried to remain behind being slaughtered. The emergent kobolds then began to prepare a vast room filled with treasure to summon their “god.”

Two years after their arrival in 478, the kobolds believed their efforts had been rewarded with the return of Nimrith. In truth, Nimrith had simply ceased his rampage across Cannor and was planning to return to the caves of the Serpentspine to slumber. Despite this, for whatever enigmatic reason Nimrith decided to remain in Khugdihr. Shortly after his return was the arrival of the Nimrithan.

The Nimrithan were a cult born in the ashes of Damescrown, the last major site of his activity during the Dragonwake. Survivors who saw the dragon as a true being of reverence, unlike the distant gods of the Castanorian Pantheon. Expelled from Damescrown for their views, they trekked in the path of the Dragon, and arrived at Khugdihr. Where they met with the kobolds, and offered all their worldly possessions to the great dragon as a sign of submission and reverence. In doing so, they were welcomed within the halls of the Red Dragon, and the Cult of the Nimrithan was born in earnest, kobold and human together.

Death of Nimrith the Red
The Nimrithan had by 1103 settled into much of Khugdihr, turning the entirety of the hold into a mixture of monastery, fortress, and treasure vault for the great dragon. Unfortunately, such wealth and opulence had attracted many over the years who sought it for themselves. With much of Cannor having recovered after the War of the Sorcerer-King, and the era of Chivalric Escann in full bloom, many saw Nimrith and his followers as the last major threat to the relative peace that had been established in Escann following the War of the Sorcerer-King.

So, a bold party of adventurers dared the inconceivable. They ventured forth to slay Nimrith the Red, and infiltrated the hold to do so. The following battle rocked the entire hold, as several days of fighting took place, devastating entire sections with dragon flame and magic. But in the end, after 625 years of residence in Khugdihr, Nimrith the Red was slain, and Khugdihr was liberated.

In the aftermath, many kobolds and human followers of Nimrith fled, most humans fled to the surface, and many kobolds into the depths of the Serpentspine. Whilst in time the Cult of Nimrith would vanish on the surface, the kobolds within the caverns of the Serpentspine would remember, after a fashion, with their beliefs and worship degenerating into what would be expected from an unsupervised kobold.

Refounding of Khugdihr
Repairment of the Hold
A few months after the death of Nimrith and the adventurers cleaning the hold of his hoard, many Agate Dwarves saw this as ample time to return in 1104, before other horrors from the Serpentspine could find their way to the hold and take residence now that Nimrith was slain. It was an extreme effort, but many Agate, and even some Stone Dwarves saw this as a once in a lifetime opportunity that could not be ignored.

Moving quickly, entire clans moved into Khugdihr and began restoration efforts, first with the main gates into and out of the hold, and then in repairing the damage to the hold itself, which included much dragon related iconography. It would take decades to truly repair the damages, and the remaining kobolds in the hold to be flushed out and killed, but after five decades of effort it was said that Khugdihr had been restored to its ancient and venerable self, just now with a few dragon-sized halls scattered throughout the hold.

Return of the Darkscales
In 1317, there was a rumbling in the deep. Down the Dwarovrod came a horde of kobolds led by a charismatic mage, numbering in the tens of thousands with only one goal: the reclamation, or utter destruction of Khugdihr. The kobolds did not simply vanish into the Serpentspine after the death of their god and master Nimrith, they instead turned their efforts to vengeance. Though it took two centuries, they consolidated and armed themselves to reclaim Khugdihr for themselves.

The siege lasted nine years, with the kobolds even going as far to breach the main gate, but even after all that time, they could not best proper dwarven steel and massed crossbow fire. The kobolds finally retreated with the death of their leader, and afterwards collapsed into a series of small tribes that scattered throughout the Serpentspine, unable to regain cohesion under the strain of goblin and orcish opportunism.

The Greentide
First Asra Expedition
A group of adventurers led by the last son of Clan Asra, Fognir Asra ventured into Asra Depths in order to recover the Gem of Asra, one of the gems of the Dwarovkron. The expedition was successful in finding the hold but in turn found an early Greentide host led by Dugorik Dragonbreaker, who was amassing his troops in order to launch a surprise attack on Khugdihr through tunnels they had excavated from the burial 6000 years in the past. The expedition successfully stopped and slew Dugorik and recovered the gem with the aid of an golem army the party had awakened.

The Fall of Khugdihr
Within the Dwarovar, things were changing. Orcish warbands were seen in the vicinity of Khugdihr as early as 1412, and with the news provided by the First Asra Expedition, Khugdihr was aware that something was coming. They could not, truly, be prepared for what occurred next.

In 1415, Korgus Dookanson led a horde of orcs to the gates of Khugdihr, establishing a siege camp; the orcs worked tirelessly, creating siege engines and counter-fortifications. The dwarves of Khugdihr were not dealing with some regular warlord, this Korgus was something completely different. There was no dissent, no jockeying for position or prestige, these orcs were not a warband, but an organised army. By 1420, the main gate had been damaged, and the Black Orcs would be contesting the entry to the hold regularly. At this point a Black Orc chieftain named Gurukk, one of the most devoted lieutenants of Korgus, would assume command of the besiegers. Korgus then returned to the depths of the Serpentspine to rally more warbands for his army.

Under the command of Gurukk, the siege turned from restrained orcish savagery to cold and brutal, but no less cunning warfare. Sappers, siege engines, and more were all employed to break the dwarves of Khugdihr. By 1423, Gurukk had seized control of more than 1/3rd of the entire hold, and had received a fresh batch of reinforcement by a force 10,000 strong trained by Korgus Dookanson himself, freshly trained and tested in the Dwarovar. By 1424, Gurukk had broken the back of the dwarven resistance, with the Agate Dwarves electing to abandon Khugdihr. A few were taken as captives. For his efforts, Gurukk was granted the name “Siegebreaker” by Korgus himself, and instructed to ensure the surface would receive a message. Dead dwarves and especially visitors to Khugdihr were piled into carts, pulled by the few surviving dwarven captives which were then spread throughout Escann, given a warning in broken dwarven by Gurukk.

“This is simply a prelude for what is to come. For you, your realms, and your gods.”

The Fall of Khugdihr caused the devastating Greentide to ravage Escann, with the orcs destroying it much like they did the Dwarovar. However, this led to a smaller number of orcs in the Serpentspine, with many dwarven expeditions setting out to reclaim their homeland soon after the death of Dookanson.

Just before Greentide ==========================================================================================================================================================================
https://anbennar.fandom.com/wiki/Hold_of_Ovdal_Asra

1410 AA - First Asra Expedition
A group of adventurers led by the last son of Clan Asra, Fognir Asra ventured into Asra Depths in order to recover the Gem of Asra, one of the gems of the Dwarovkron.
The expedition members consisted of Orbar the Loyal, Mintbrick Puddlebonk, Ebbo "Lightfingers" Goodloot, Jaerel the Mistwalker and Gerin Orcrend.

The expedition was successful in finding the hold but in turn found an early Greentide host led by Dugorik Dragonbreaker,
who was amassing his troops in order to launch a surprise attack on Khugdihr through tunnels they had excavated from the burial 6000 years in the past.
The expedition successfully stopped and slew Dugorik and recovered the gem with the aid of a golem army that Mintbrick awakened.
This, unfortunately, caused a cave collapse that buried Ovdal Asra completely, with Gerin and Mintbrick with it.
Miraculously, Gerin managed to escape the cave collapse afterwards, venturing further into the Dwarovar.

Using the gem, Fognir became known as Fognir "the Resurgent" and united many dwarven families and cartels under the Asra Bank.
